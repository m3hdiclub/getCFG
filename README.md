# Multi Proxy Config Fetcher

This project automatically fetches and updates various proxy configurations from public Telegram channels. It supports multiple proxy protocols including WireGuard, Hysteria2, VLESS, VMess, Shadowsocks, and Trojan.

## Channel Performance

Below is the real-time performance statistics of the configured channels. This chart is automatically updated every hour.

> **Note**: These channels are configured as examples. You can easily modify the channel list in `src/config.py` to use your preferred Telegram channels. The success rates shown above are based on real-time monitoring of each channel's reliability in providing valid configurations.

## Features

- Supports multiple proxy protocols:
  - WireGuard
  - Hysteria2
  - VLESS
  - VMess
  - Shadowsocks (SS)
  - Trojan
- Smart handling of base64-encoded configs (preserves original format)
- Intelligent config naming (adds #AnonX only to non-base64 configs)
- Protocol-specific validation and verification
- Fetches configs from multiple Telegram channels
- Automatically updates configs every hour
- Validates config age (excludes configs older than 2 days)
- Removes duplicates
- Tracks channel reliability and success rates
- Balances config distribution across protocols

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit `src/config.py` and add your Telegram channels to `TELEGRAM_CHANNELS` list
3. Enable GitHub Actions in your forked repository
4. The configs will be automatically updated every hour in `configs/proxy_configs.txt`

## Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-proxy-config-fetcher.git
cd multi-proxy-config-fetcher

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run manually
python src/fetch_configs.py
```

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.py` to modify:
- Telegram channel list
- Minimum/maximum configs per protocol
- Protocol ratios and balancing
- Maximum config age
- Output file location
- Supported protocols
- Request headers and timeouts
